Here is a summary of the lambda-bridge protocol.

Standard Lambda Bridge Socket:
* Open the port
* Send bytes, receive bytes
* (To check) or send pkts, receive pkts
* 1 input, 1 output FIFO / pipe

Byte-based Lambda Bridge Socket (for example, 232)
* Open the port
* Sends byte-ized packets
* Waits for Acks

Packet-based Lambda Bridge Socket (for example, 232)
* Open the port
* Sends packets
* Waits for Acks
