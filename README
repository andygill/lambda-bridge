Lambda bridge is a generic bridge from Haskell (on a CPU) to VHDL on a FPGA.

In order to use the lambda bridge, you need to set the LB_PATH environment variable.

For example

% export LB_PATH=`pwd`/bridges/bin

If you type

% make bridges

Then the package will attempt to build the bridges (and put them in to bridges/bin)
