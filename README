Lambda bridge is a generic bridge from Haskell (on a CPU) to VHDL on a FPGA.

Directory Structure

 * Network -- the Haskell source
   * Network/LambdaBridge/*.hs -- generic Haskell "network" code for building lambda bridges.

 * drivers -- The lambda-bridge device driver, in user-space. They are implemented
   as stand alone user processes that are invoked from the [lb_]board_connect function
   in C or Haskell. By convention, the lambda-bridge driver binaries start with lb_.

 * connect -- C implementation of lb_board_connect.
 
 * examples -- Examples of using some generic/toy bridges.

 * runners -- programs/applications that *use* the lambda-bridge
    * udp_lbshell -- Allows the remote invocation of lambda-bridge commands.

In order to use the lambda bridge, you need to set the PATH environment variable, 
to find the bridges. For example

% export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/bridges/bin
or
% export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/bridges/bin:`pwd`/dist/build/haskell-test2-bridge

If you type

% make bridges

Then the package will attempt to build the bridges (and put them in to bridges/bin)
