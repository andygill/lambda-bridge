Lambda bridge is a generic bridge from Haskell (on a CPU) to VHDL on a FPGA.

Directory Structure

 * Network -- the Haskell source
   * Network/LambdaBridge/*.hs -- generic Haskell "network" code for building lambda bridges.

 * drivers -- The lambda-bridge device driver, in user-space. They are implemented
   as stand alone user processes that are invoked from the [lb_]board_connect function
   in C or Haskell. By convention, the lambda-bridge driver binaries start with lb_.

 * connect -- C implementation of lb_board_connect.
 
 * examples -- Examples of using some generic/toy bridges.
    haskell-cat -- Example of calling the cat driver.

 * runners -- programs/applications that *use* the lambda-bridge
    * udp_lbshell -- Allows the remote invocation of lambda-bridge commands.
    * stdio_lbshell -- Allows a lambda bridge driver to be used via stdio and the UNIX shell.

In order to use the lambda bridge, you need to set the PATH environment variable, 
to find the bridges. For example

% export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/dist/build/lb_cat
